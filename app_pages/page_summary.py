                <p>
                For many people, pets are an important part of their lives. However, some people 
                struggle to keep track of all their pets' needs due to an irregular work schedule 
                or their own health issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                Moreover, <b>pet obesity</b> has increased dramatically over the past decade, with up to
                60% of all pets meeting the criteria of being obese, according to a 
                <a href="https://veterinairepetcare.com/blog/key-pet-obesity-statistics-facts-2023.html" 
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">study by APOP</a>.
                <br><br>
                One of the reasons for pet obesity is overfeeding.
                <br><br>
                To lighten the pet owners' burden while ensuring the pets' wellbeing,
                the client is building an <b>automated food dispenser</b> for pet animals. The product
                is targeted towards owners with at least two visually distinguishable animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                The product will ensure that each pet that comes up to the feeder receives the
                correct type and amount of food at preset intervals, allowing the pet owner to adjust the
                pets' diets in accordance to the veterinarian's advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                To this end, the product will be equipped with a motion sensor and a camera that will 
                take a series of snapshots whenever it detects movement. The device software will then
                run the image batch against a pretrained model, deciding which pet has triggered its activation.
                </p>
                <p>
                In case of a successful classification, it will proceed to dispense food and record the 
                interaction for further assessment.
